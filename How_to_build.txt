Here is a short summary  for anyone that wants to try compiling their own kernel.
Personally I found Ubuntu Mint 14 a good base for this, since it was easy to get working on a virtaul machine.
The linux environment will also need some initial setup before it is ready to compile.

run this command to install some needed packages:
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential kernel-package libncurses5-dev bzip2

Some toolchains will require that you have the libisl.so.13 installed. To do so, you need to edit your /etc/apt/sources.list and add these lines:
	deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian experimental main contrib non-free
	deb-src http://ftp.debian.org/debian experimental main contrib non-free
Then do an "apt-get update"
followed by "apt-get install libisl13"
If you get another error about missimg libcloog-isl4, then try this: "apt-get install libcloog-isl4"


Currently the Makefile is set to use the Sabermod 4.9 graphite toolchain, so you will need this toolchain.
Look in the Makefile for the correct folder location or edit if you want to change it to a different toolchain.
The toolchain I did use can be found from here: https://github.com/kecinzer/sm-arm-eabi-4.9
Additionally you will need a set of tools, like the dbToolCM to create the dt.img file, 
and the mkbootimg to create your boot.img file. 
You will also need the split_boot script tool to extract a ramdisk from a working boot.img
Here you might find a working set of tools:

Some of these tools could be hard to find. I have therefore put the ones I use the most in an archive at my google-drive.
You will also find a copy of the ramdisk files initrd.img for both 4.4.2 and 4.4.4 (CM11) kernels.
Here is the sharing link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2iMg7GOiEtwNWFNb0RoZE1RVUk/view?usp=sharing

Open a terminal in the source folder and apply the following commands:
sudo su
make clean && make mrproper
make ARCH=arm msm8226-sec_defconfig VARIANT_DEFCONFIG=msm8226-sec_matissewifi_defconfig
make arch=arm
./dtbToolCM -2 -o ~/dt_files/dt.img -s 2048 -p ./scripts/dtc/ ./arch/arm/boot/


If the dbToolCM command fails, make sure you have the /dt_files folder. If not, create it or specify another output 
folder of your wish. Then retry.
The dbToolCM will output a file, dt.img. Copy this to a folder of choice. 
Also copy the file /arch/arm/boot/zImage to the same folder folder.
You will need a ramdisk file, initrd.img. For this you need to use an existing boot.img file and split it using the 
split_boot script. That script will create a boot folder, and you will see a file named boot.img-ramdisk.cpio.gz. 
Just rename that file to initrd.img and copy it to your folder.


Open a terminal in the folder you choose above and apply the following command:

./mkbootimg --base 0x00000000 --kernel zImage --ramdisk_offset 0x02000000 --tags_offset 0x01E00000 --pagesize 2048 --cmdline "androidboot.hardware=qcom user_debug=31 maxcpus=2 msm_rtb.filter=0x3F ehci-hcd.park=3 msm_rtb.enable=0 lpj=192598 dwc3.maximum_speed=high dwc3_msm.prop_chg_detect=Y" --ramdisk initrd.img --dt dt.img -o boot.img


If all goes well, a boot.img file will be created.
Thats it, you now have compiled a kernel:)
